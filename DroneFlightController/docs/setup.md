# Setup Guide for Drone Flight Controller

## Introduction

This document provides detailed instructions for setting up the hardware and software components required to run the Drone Flight Controller on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller.

- [Testing the Setup](#testing-the-setup)

## Hardware Setup

### Required Components
- **ARM Cortex-M4 Development Board** (e.g., STM32F4 series)
- **IMU Sensor** (e.g., MPU6050 or similar)
- **Motor Drivers** (compatible with PWM control)
- **Power Distribution Board** (for connecting motors and battery)
- **Battery** (LiPo or suitable battery for your drone)
- **Wiring and Connectors** (for I2C/SPI communication)

### Wiring Diagram
Refer to the wiring diagram provided in the `hardware/` directory of the project. Make sure to connect the components as follows:

- **IMU Sensor Connections**:
  - Connect SDA and SCL pins of the IMU to the corresponding I2C pins on the development board.
  - Connect VCC and GND to power the sensor.

- **Motor Driver Connections**:
  - Connect PWM signal pins from the development board to the motor driver inputs.
  - Connect the motor driver outputs to the drone's motors.

- **Power Connections**:
  - Connect the battery to the power distribution board and ensure that all components receive power.

## Software Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Xcode**: Install from the Mac App Store.
- **ARM GCC Toolchain**: Install the ARM GNU toolchain suitable for your development environment.
- **FreeRTOS**: Download and integrate FreeRTOS into your project. You can find it at [FreeRTOS.org](https://www.freertos.org/).

### Project Configuration
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drone-flight-controller.git
   cd drone-flight-controller
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**:
   - Open Xcode and select **Open another project**.
   - Navigate to the `drone-flight-controller` folder and open the `.xcodeproj` file.

3. **Set Up Dependencies**:
   - Ensure that all required libraries and frameworks (like FreeRTOS) are properly linked in your project settings.
   - Adjust the build settings to match your hardware specifications.

### Compiling the Project
1. **Build the Project**:
   - In Xcode, select your target and click on the build button or use the shortcut `Command + B`.
   - Ensure that there are no compilation errors.

## Flashing the Firmware

1. **Connect the Development Board**:
   - Use a USB cable to connect the ARM Cortex-M4 development board to your computer.

2. **Open the Terminal**:
   - If you are using OpenOCD or any other flashing tool, open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. **Flash the Firmware**:
   - Use the following command (replace with your actual flashing command/tool):
     ```bash
     openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32f4x.cfg -c "program build/DroneFlightController.elf verify reset exit"
     ```

## Testing the Setup

1. **Power Up the Drone**:
   - After successfully flashing the firmware, connect the battery to power up the drone.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - Monitor the console output (if available) to check for any error messages during initialization.
   - Verify that the IMU sensor is detected and calibrated correctly.

3. **Conduct Test Flights**:
   - Perform initial test flights in a safe environment to ensure that the flight controller is functioning correctly.
   - Make adjustments to PID parameters as needed to optimize flight performance.

## Conclusion

This setup guide should help you successfully configure both the hardware and software for the Drone Flight Controller. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the project's README.md file for additional resources or seek assistance from the community.
